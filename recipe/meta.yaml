  summary: APSW stands for Another Python SQLite Wrapper.
  description: |
    APSW is a Python wrapper for the SQLite embedded relational database
    engine. It focuses translating between the complete SQLite C API and
    Python's C API. It is recommended to use the builtin sqlite3 module, unless
    you want SQLite specific functionality. The documentation has a section on
    the differences between APSW and sqlite3. APSW supports CPython 3.6
    onwards:
