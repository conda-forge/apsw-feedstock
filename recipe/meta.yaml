  summary: APSW stands for Another Python SQLite Wrapper.
  description: |
    APSW is a Python wrapper for the SQLite embedded relational database
    engine. In contrast to other wrappers such as pysqlite it focuses on being
    a minimal layer over SQLite attempting just to translate the complete
    SQLite API into Python. The documentation has a section on the differences
    between APSW and pysqlite. APSW supports CPython 2.3 onwards and CPython
    3.1 onwards.
